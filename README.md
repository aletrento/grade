a collection of grammar drills in English

If you are an English teacher (or learner) and you need to make quick grammar tests, this website can be a useful resource for you.
It allows you to select the type(s) of exercise you need, as well as one or more grammar topics.

The PHP pages of this website retrieve data from a MySQL databse which contains the grammar exercises.
The database is not included in this package, but so far it includes five types of exercises:

-    multiple choice
-    cloze
-    (re)write sentences
-    correct mistakes
-    ask questions

If you feel like giving it a try, visit: http://www.greid.altervista.org/

Please note that the PHP class 'phpmailer' (https://github.com/Synchro/PHPMailer) is used in this website to send the retrieved exercises by e-mail.
